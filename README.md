# Tool Overview: 
The Protection Profile (PP) XML Builder is a form-filling application that allows a user to either import, edit, and export PP XML files, or to generate a PP XML file from an empty template. No knowledge of XML is needed to edit or generate a PP XML file.
# Feature Outline and Guide:
General Usage: (Read this first!) 
-	The tool is currently designed to assist in the development of Base PPs only. When opening the tool, a user will be presented with a blank form that can be filled out with many editable sections of a standard PP, such as Overview, Threats, Objectives, and SFRs.
-	The tool currently allows for the import of Base PPs only. To work with a Base PP (Application, Mobile Device, Operating System, Virtualization, General Purpose Computing Platforms), download the xml file you wish to work with from the associated GitHub Repo and import it into the tool using the “Configure XML Options.” Menu option in the navigation bar on the left-hand side. THIS STEP MAY TAKE A FEW MINUTES. PLEASE BE PATIENT.
-	 Once loaded, the tool will be filled with data from the PP. Some of this data will not be visible/editable, but will be generated by the transforms process when the xml file produced by the tool is loaded into the GitHub repo for that PP.
• Audit/Management Tables: Audit and Management Tables are not yet implemented.
• Images: Images are not yet implemented.
• SFR Creation: The SFR section allows a user to easily view all imported SFRs and to create more in a fashion that does not require XML, but still produces well-formed, usable XML for the purposes of creating release documents through the use of the transforms process, and for the purposes of automation.
• Tests: Tests have been standardized into a testlist > tests > test format. If the imported XML implements a different tag structure, the information from those tags will be loaded into a general-purpose textbox. The text in that textbox can then be moved to the correct testlist/test structure (with dependencies).
• Extended Component Definition: Extended Component Definitions are supported for all PPs. Application 1.4 will not display any Extended Component Definitions when loaded, but they may be added via the tool’s functions.
• XML Preview/export: There is an XML preview toggle on the upper right side of the tool which will allow a user to view the XML that will be generated upon export. There is an export option in the left-hand navigation bar that will allow a user to download the generated XML to their downloads folder.
Considerations: (As of July 2024)
• This tool is a proof-of-concept and is in “Phase 1” of development. At least one further phase is planned.
• The Phase 1 implementation of this tool currently handles the following base PPs only:
-	Application 1.4 
-	MDF 3.3 
-	GPOS 4.3 
-	GPCP 1.0 
-	Virtualization 1.1
• The Phase 1 implementation does not allow for editing of the following elements, and supports pass-through export only:
-	Management Functions and Audit Tables
-	Security Assurance Requirements
-	Most appendices beyond A, B, and C
-	Include-pkg and module related external dependencies

THIS REPO IS THE INITIAL DEPLOYMENT OF A PROTOTYPE AND EVALUATION TOOL.
 IT IS NOT MEANT FOR GENERAL USE.
Please provide any feedback you have to the issues board associated with this repo. Your feedback will help this tool or any that comes after it and is greatly appreciated!
